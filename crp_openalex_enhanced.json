      "abstract": "Abstract Each year, billions of dollars of public funds are expended to purchase conservation easements on farmland. One unintended impact of these programs is that they may bring non‐cropland into crop production. Such a slippage effect can be caused by increased output prices and by substitution effects. This article shows that for each one hundred acres of cropland retired under the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) in the central United States, twenty acres of non‐cropland were converted to cropland, offsetting 9% and 14% of CRP water and wind erosion reduction benefits, respectively. Implications of these results for the design of conservation programs are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Subsurface drainage of gravitational water from the soil profile through tiles is a common practice used to improve crop production on poorly drained soils. Previous research has often shown significant concentrations of nitrate-N (NO3-N) in drainage water from row-crop systems, but little drainage research has been conducted under perennial crops such as those used in the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP). Four cropping systems (continuous corn, a corn-soybean rotation, alfalfa, and CRP) were established in 1988 to determine aboveground biomass yields, N uptake, residual soil N (RSN), soil water content, and NO3 losses to subsurface tile drainage water as influenced by cropping system. Hydrologic-year rainfall during the 6-yr study ranged from 23% below normal to 66% above normal. In dry years, yields were limited, RSN accumulated at elevated levels in all crop systems but especially in the row-crop systems, soil water reserves and RSN were reduced to as deep as 2.7 m in the alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) and CRP systems, and tile drainage did not occur. Drainage occurred only in the corn (Zea mays L.) and soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] systems in the year of normal rainfall. In years of excess precipitation, drainage from the row-crop systems exceeded that from the perennial crops by 1.1 to 5.3X. Flow-weighted average NO3-N concentrations in the water during the flow period of this study were continuous corn = 32, corn-soybean rotation = 24, alfalfa = 3 and CRP = 2 mg/L. Nitrate losses in the subsurface drainage water from the continuous corn and corn-soybean systems were about 37X and 35X higher, respectively, than from the alfalfa and CRP systems due primarily to greater season-long ET resulting in less drainage and greater uptake and/or immobilization of N by the perennial crops.",

This paper reviews the history of the CRP and the evolution of its enrollment mechanism. I discuss the use of bid caps and the Environmental Benefits Index bid ranking mechanism in the “general” CRP; and the use of highly targeted, but non-competitive, “continuous” CRP. Possible challenges of these designs are discussed, and alternative auction mechanisms are considered that could be more cost effective.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Performance of the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) in meeting the political preferences of its administrators is highly sensitive to the choice of eligibility, bid solicitation, and bid selection criteria used in making program implementation decisions. Decisions made in the first year of CRP implementation led to suboptimal results; net government cost could have been reduced while simultaneously increasing the extent to which erosion and supply control objectives were met. Simulation of the outcomes for a fully enrolled reserve under alternative implementation schemes indicates that future performance can be improved by manipulating key control variables to directly target preferences.",

      "abstract": "Over 13 million ha of former cropland are enrolled in the US Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), providing well-recognized biodiversity, water quality, and carbon (C) sequestration benefits that could be lost on conversion back to agricultural production. Here we provide measurements of the greenhouse gas consequences of converting CRP land to continuous corn, corn–soybean, or perennial grass for biofuel production. No-till soybeans preceded the annual crops and created an initial carbon debt of 10.6 Mg CO 2 equivalents (CO 2 e)·ha −1 that included agronomic inputs, changes in C stocks, altered N 2 O and CH 4 fluxes, and foregone C sequestration less a fossil fuel offset credit. Total debt, which includes future debt created by additional changes in soil C stocks and the loss of substantial future soil C sequestration, can be constrained to 68 Mg CO 2 e·ha −1 if subsequent crops are under permanent no-till management. If tilled, however, total debt triples to 222 Mg CO 2 e·ha −1 on account of further soil C loss. Projected C debt repayment periods under no-till management range from 29 to 40 y for corn–soybean and continuous corn, respectively. Under conventional tillage repayment periods are three times longer, from 89 to 123 y, respectively. Alternatively, the direct use of existing CRP grasslands for cellulosic feedstock production would avoid C debt entirely and provide modest climate change mitigation immediately. Incentives for permanent no till and especially permission to harvest CRP biomass for cellulosic biofuel would help to blunt the climate impact of future CRP conversion.",

However, there are other unintentional yet significant ecological benefits to the program that merit evaluation. These benefits include the reversal of landscape fragmentation, maintenance of regional biodiversity, creation of wildlife habitat, and favorable changes in regional carbon flux. These and other benefits should be used by policy makers and federal officials to maintain the program even after enrollment expectations have been achieved.",

      "abstract": "The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)'s Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) resulted in the conversion of about 1.9 million ha of cropland to perennial grass cover in the Prairie Pothole Region of North Dakota, South Dakota, and northeastern Montana by 1992. Many wildlife managers believed this cover would provide benefits to wildlife, including upland nesting ducks. During 1992-1995, we evaluated success of 5 duck species nesting in CRP fields and nearby Waterfowl Production Areas (WPA) throughout the region. We examined relationships between daily survival rates (DSR) of duck nests in CRP cover and landscape-level habitat and population parameters. We computed DSR of duck nests in other major cover types in our study area from data collected during 1980-1984 (pre-CRP) and 1990-1994 (CRP) periods. We then applied recruitment models to estimate duck production in our study area during peak CRP years (1992-1997) and compared these results with those that simulated the scenario in which cropland was in place of CRP cover (i.e., the CRP had not occurred). DSR were higher in all habitats combined during the CRP period compared to the pre-CRP period. Regressions of DSR in CRP cover on the percent of each study plot in perennial cover and geographic location were significant (P < 0.01) for 4 of 5 duck (Anas spp.) species. Estimated nest success and recruitment rates for the 5 species combined during 1992-1997 were 46% and 30% higher, respectively, with CRP cover on the landscape compared to a scenario where we simulated cropland in place of CRP. Our model estimated an additional 12.4 million recruits from our study area to the fall flight as a consequence of the CRP during 1992-1997. Our results document benefits to 5 duck species in the northern plains associated with a farm program that provided financial incentives to landowners for planting undisturbed grass cover as an alternative to annual crops.",

      "abstract": "We compared avian use of Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) fields enrolled in the CP1 (cool-season grasses and legumes) and CP2 (warm-season native grasses) options in southeastern Nebraska from 1991 to 1995. In winter and in the breeding season CP2 fields had taller, denser vegetation than CP1 fields. However, total bird abundance did not differ between CP1 and CP2 fields (P = 0.47). Dickcissels (Spiza americana) and grasshopper sparrows (Ammodramus savannarum) were the most abundant species during the breeding season although population numbers varied among years (P < 0.001). Dickcissels and grasshopper sparrows showed no differences in abundance between CPs, but dickcissels were associated with tall, dense vegetation and grasshopper sparrows with sparser vegetation and a shallow litter layer. Bobolinks (Dolichonyx oryzivorus) were more abundant on CP1 fields (P = 0.001), and common yellowthroats (Geothlypis trichas) and sedge wrens (Cistothorus platensis) were more abundant on CP2 fields (P = 0.001 and P = 0.05). Average winter abundances did not change over years (P = 0.90). American tree sparrows (Spizella arborea) and ring-necked pheasants (Phasianus colchicus) were the most abundant species during winter and were more abundant on CP2 fields (P < 0.05). Meadowlarks (Sturnella spp.) were more abundant on CP1 fields in winter (P < 0.05).",

      "abstract": "Switchgrass ( Panicum virgatum L.) has been planted on land enrolled in the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP). Management strategies for conversion of this land from CRP to biomass energy require evaluation. Objectives of this study were to: (i) determine the effect of harvest timing and N rate on biomass production and characteristics of switchgrass land enrolled in or managed similarly to CRP and (ii) evaluate the impact of harvest management on species composition and persistence. Five N rates (spring applications of 0, 56, 112, and 224 kg ha −1 and 224 kg ha −1 split between spring and postharvest) and two harvest timings (anthesis and post‐killing frost) were applied to plots from 2001 to 2003 at three South Dakota locations. Harvesting after a killing frost produced higher total yields and improved switchgrass persistence compared with anthesis harvests. The concentration of neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent fiber (ADF), and acid detergent lignin (ADL) increased between anthesis and killing‐frost harvests, while total nitrogen (TN) and ash decreased. Nitrogen applied at 56 kg ha −1 increased total biomass without affecting switchgrass persistence, but there was no additional benefit with N above 56 kg ha −1 Harvesting long‐established switchgrass stands once per year after a killing frost and applying N at 56 kg ha −1 was an effective system for switchgrass biomass production and persistence on land enrolled in or managed similarly to CRP in South Dakota.",

      "abstract": "Although the effects of cultivation on soil organic matter and nutrient supply capacity are well understood, relatively little work has been done on the long‐term recovery of soils from cultivation. We sampled soils from 12 locations within the Pawnee National Grasslands of northeastern Colorado, each having native fields and fields that were historically cultivated but abandoned 50 yr ago. We also sampled fields that had been cultivated for at least 50 yr at 5 of these locations. Our results demonstrated that soil organic matter, silt content, microbial biomass, potentially mineralizable N, and potentially respirable C were significantly lower on cultivated fields than on native fields. Both cultivated and abandoned fields also had significantly lower soil organic matter and silt contents than native fields. Abandoned fields, however, were not significantly different from native fields with respect to microbial biomass, potentially mineralizable N, or respirable C. In addition, we found that the characteristic small‐scale heterogeneity of the shortgrass steppe associated with individuals of the dominant plant, Bouteloua gracilis, had recovered on abandoned fields. Soil beneath plant canopies had an average of 200 g/m 2 more C than between‐plant locations. We suggest that 50 yr is an adequate time for recovery of active soil organic matter and nutrient availability, but recovery of total soil organic matter pools is a much slower process. Plant population dynamics may play an important role in the recovery of shortgrass steppe ecosystems from disturbance, such that establishment of perennial grasses determines the rate of organic matter recovery.",

      "abstract": "Grassland passerines were surveyed during summer 1995 on the Buffalo Ridge Wind Resource Area in southwestern Minnesota to determine the relative influence of wind turbines on overall densities of upland nesting birds in Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) grasslands. Birds were surveyed along 40 m fixed width transects that were placed along wind turbine strings within three CRP fields and in three CRP fields without turbines. Conservation Reserve Program grasslands without turbines and areas located 180 m from turbines supported higher densities (261.0-312.5 males/100 ha) of grassland birds than areas within 80 m of turbines (58.2-128.0 males/100 ha). Human disturbance, turbine noise, and physical movements of turbines during operation may have distrurbed nesting birds. We recommend that wind turbines be placed within cropland habitats that support lower densities of grassland passerines than those found in CRP grasslands.

      "abstract": "This report estimates the impact that high levels of enrollment in the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) have had on economic trends in rural counties since the program's inception in 1985 until today. The results of a growth model and quasi-experimental control group analysis indicate no discernible impact by the CRP on aggregate county population trends. Aggregate employment growth may have slowed in some high-CRP counties, but only temporarily. High levels of CRP enrollment appear to have affected farm-related businesses over the long run, but growth in the number of other nonfarm businesses moderated CRP's impact on total employment. If CRP contracts had ended in 2001, simulation models suggest that roughly 51 percent of CRP land would have returned to crop production, and that spending on outdoor recreation would decrease by as much as $300 million per year in rural areas. The resulting impacts on employment and income vary widely among regions having similar CRP enrollments, depending upon local economic conditions.",

      "abstract": "The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) has effected major changes to the landscape, especially in the northern Great Plains. Breeding birds have responded dramatically to habitat changes by colonizing CRP fields, often in large numbers. The vegetation in most CRP fields consists of introduced grasses and legumes, along with a variety ofweedy species. This paper describes the bird populations found during three years ofsurveys on more than 300 CRPfields in western Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, and eastern Montana. Tfe relate densities of selected species to geographic location, annual effects, conservation practice adopted, and vegetation features. In 1985 the Food Security Act established the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) primarily to conserve and improve soil and water resources of highly erodible cropland. Emphasis was placed on taking out of agricultural production certain highly erodible or eroding lands by establishing perennial cover on them, thereby reducing soil erosion and sedimentation of streams, and improving water quality. Another objective was to enhance habitat for fish and wildlife populations. Related to that objective, we evaluated the use by breeding birds of selected CRP fields in eastern Montana, North and South Dakota, and western Minnesota. With about 4 million hectares, these four states contain nearly 30% ofall land enrolled in the Program; thus, the CRP is of enormous importance in that region. Because CRP habitat is new, evaluations of its value to wildlife are limited. Studies have been completed on nesting in CRP fields by ducks (Luttschwager 1991; Kantrud 1993) and by Ring-necked Pheasants (Berthelsen et al. 1990; see American Ornithologists' Union 1983 for scientific names). King (1991) surveyed birds on4-6 CRP fields and some alternative habitats in eastern Nebraska during 1989-1990. Attempts have been made to measure habitat changes resulting from CRP and to predict subsequent effects on certain birds through various models (Hays et al. 1989; Stauffer et al. 1989). As yet, however, little published information exists on actual use of",

      "abstract": "-PreViOUS studies have shown that habitat provided by the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), a feature of the 1985 farm bill, is used by many birds. The present study quantitatively assesses the importance of the CRP by estimating changes in breedingbird populations of North Dakota projected if CRP land would revert to cultivation. Of 18 species that were common in CRP or crop fields or both, 12 were more abundant in CRP habitats. Six of these species had suffered significant population declines during 1967-1990, according to the North American Breeding Bird Survey. In contrast, none of the six species that were more common in cropland than in CRP fields had declined significantly. Termination of the Conservation Reserve Program and a return of enrolled land to cultivation is projected to cause population declines in North Dakota exceeding 17% for Sedge Wren (Cistothorus platensis), Grasshopper Sparrow (Ammodramus savannarum), Savannah Sparrow (Passerculus sandwichensis), Dickcissel (Spiza americana), and Lark Bunting (Calamospiza melanocorys). Received 27 October 1994, accepted II May 1995. The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), established by the 1985 Food Security Act and administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, resulted in the reversion of millions of hectares of marginal cropland to perennial cover (Young and Osborn 1990). The primary objectives of the CRP were to bring crop supplies more in line with demands and to conserve soil and water resources. Certain highly erodible or eroding lands were removed from agricultural production, through IO-year contracts and annual payments, by establishing perennial vegetation. The intent was to reduce soil erosion, reduce sedimentation of streams, and thus improve water quality. Contracts begin to expire in the next few years, and most landowners indicated an intention to return their lands to cultivation (Mortensen et al. 1989, Kurzejeski et al. 1992). A secondary objective of the CRP was to enhance habitat for fish and wildlife populations. Grassland habitats established by the CRP benefit a variety of wildlife species (King 1991, Luttschwager and Higgins 1992, Hall and Willig 1994), especially breeding birds (Johnson and Schwartz 1993a, b; Kantrud 1993). Populations of many grassland birds have declined in recent decades, especially in areas of intensive agriculture, such as the Midwest (Warner 1994) and the northern Great Plains (Johnson and Schwartz 1993b). Johnson and Schwartz (1993b) found that the two most common breeding-bird species observed in CRP fields in the north’ National Biological Service, Northern Prairie Science Center Jamestown, North Dakota 58401",

      "abstract": "The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) has been eredited with contributing substantially to the conservation of grassland birds. Although many species have nested in grasslands established under the CRP, little evidence of positive effect on populations has been reported. We measured reproductive rates and estimated fecundity of 7 grassland bird species in CRP fields in northern Missouri and compared those rates to estimates of fecundity needed to maintain stable populations (λ = 1). Under conservative assumptions of survival, CRP fields seemingly were source habitats (fecundity exceeded levels necessary for λ = 1) for grasshopper sparrows (Ammodramus savannarum) and field sparrows (Spizella pusilla) in at least 2 of 3 years (1993: P = 0.02, 1995: P < 0.001) and pooled over 3 years (Ps < 0.001). Although evidence was less compelling, CRP fields were likely source habitat for eastern meadowlarks (Sturnella magna) and American goldfinches (Carduelis tristis). For American goldfinches, fecundity was greater than that necessary for λ = 1 in 1995 (P < 0.001), and pooled over 3 years (P < 0.001). Our pooled estimate of fecundity was greater than necessary for λ = 1 for eastern meadowlarks (Ps < 0.001), but only under a liberal assumption of survival in 2 of 3 years (1993: P = 0.001; 1995: P = 0.088). Fecundity of common yellowthroats (Geothlypis trichas) varied substantially; therefore, source-sink status alternated among years, although the pooled estimate of fecundity was less than required for λ = 1 (P < 0.001). Dickcissel (Spiza americano) fecundity was consistently less than necessary for λ = 1 (conservative survival assumption: all Ps < 0.001; liberal survival assumption: 1994 P - 0.008. pooled P = 0.014). For red-winged blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus), CRP fields were consistently a sink habitat (all Ps < 0.001). Based on our evidence, the CRP likely has contributed to the conservation of grasshopper sparrows, field sparrows. and eastern meadowlarks. Although large numbers of dickcissels and red-winged black-birds nested in CRP fields, there is little evidence that the CRP has contributed to populations of those species.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  Soil quality indicators may be useful for evaluating public policies such as the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP). The objective of this study was to determine how CRP affected several physical, chemical, and biological indicators of soil quality. Soil aggregate stability and size distribution, bulk density, total organic C and N, nitrate-N, ammonium-N, pH, cation exchange capacity, microbial biomass C and N, soil respiration, fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis, fungal hyphal length, and ergosterol concentrations were measured in paired CRP and cropland sites in Iowa, Minnesota, North Dakota, and Washington. CRP sites in Iowa generally had a higher percentage of water stable soil aggregates than cropland sites. In Minnesota, the mean aggregate diameter was significantly higher in CRP than cropland samples, but differences in North Dakota were not significant. In all states, microbial biomass carbon was 17 to 64% higher at CRP sites than at cropland or fallow sites. Nitrate-N was 18 to 74% higher in cropland than CRP sites. Soil respiration values were greater (but not significantly different) in CRP than cropland sites in all four states. Hyphal length, measured only in Iowa, increased 26 to 62% under CRP. CRP samples had higher ergosterol only in Henry County, Iowa, where cropland was chisel plowed and disced each year. Overall, soil biological indicators showed more significant differences than either chemical or physical indicators. This multi-state project shows that several soil quality indicators were improved by placing highly erodible cropland into perennial grass, and that with refinement, those indicators could be used to assess long-term impacts of agricultural management practices.",

      "abstract": "Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) land on which perennial warm‐season grasses are grown could be a resource for bioenergy feedstock production and C sequestration. A 4‐yr field experiment was conducted to determine the response of switchgrass ( Panicum virgatum L.) and soil C sequestration to N fertility and harvest frequency on switchgrass‐dominated CRP land in eastern South Dakota. Soil at the site is an Egan silty clay loam. Three N rates (0, 112, and 224 kg ha −1 ) were applied as NH 4 NO 3 (NH 4 NO 3 –N) and cattle ( Bos taurus L.) manure (manure‐N). Switchgrass was harvested at anthesis every year (EY) or alternate years (AY) from 2001 to 2004. Soil samples were collected before starting the experiment (fall 2000) and after 4 yr (fall 2004) to determine C sequestration. Averaged across N rate, the proportion of switchgrass was higher with manure‐N (64.7%) than NH 4 NO 3 ‐N (46.8%). Total (switchgrass plus other herbaceous material) biomass production tended to be higher when harvested EY (average 5.0 Mg ha −1 yr −1 ) compared with AY (average 4.0 Mg ha −1 yr −1 ). However, by 2004, the proportion of switchgrass was 75% higher in plots harvested AY compared with those harvested EY. The concentration of structural components was greater in biomass harvested AY, whereas total N and ash tended to be lower. Total‐N and ash concentrations in biomass were higher with NH 4 NO 3 ‐N than manure‐N. Soil C was sequestered at a rate of 2.4 ± 0.9 and 4.0 ± 1.0 Mg C ha −1 yr −1 at the 0‐ to 90‐cm depth with NH 4 NO 3 –N and manure‐N, respectively. There were no changes in soil organic C without N fertilization. Manure could be used as an alternate N source for switchgrass biomass production on CRP land with an added benefit of increased C sequestration.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Chemical and microbial aspects of soil quality are an important consideration when evaluating the benefits of soil conservation efforts such as the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP). The objective of this study was to evaluate the quality of CRP and wheat‐fallow (W‐F) soils using soil biological and chemical parameters and C and N mineralization processes. The study was conducted on 20 CRP/W‐F paired sites in eastern Washington, on Ritzville silt loam (coarse‐silty, mixed, mesic Calciorthidic Haploxerolls). Soils collected from the paired fields were analyzed for chemical and biological parameters that have been suggested as indicators of soil quality. Potential enzyme activities and soil N were higher in the CRP soil than the W‐F soil. Although there were no significant differences in total organic carbon (TOC) or microbial biomass carbon (MBC) the C mineralization potentials and C pools were significantly different between the CRP and W‐F soils. Soil biota measurements showed there was greater active bacterial biomass in the CRP soil but greater fungal‐feeding nematodes, flagellates, and amoebae in the W‐F soil. The C mineralization study suggests that there is a significant increase in the secondary C pool of the CRP soil, which may indicate a buildup of higher quality soil organic matter and the potential for higher enzyme levels. When grass or straw was added to each soil type, the W‐F soil produced more CO 2 with either substrate than the CRP soil, indicating C limiting conditions in the W‐F soil. Since it is unknown what constitutes good soil quality, these shifts in chemical and biological parameters may seem subtle. However, in general, trends in the data indicated that soil quality in the CRP was improved after 4 to 7 yr, compared with its previous management in W‐F cropland.",

This study contributes to the literature by developing a framework for ex post analysis of uncertainty and irreversibility. It extends the applications of real options models to analyze farmer participation in the CRP. The model incorporates land and owner attributes, and determines whether uncertainty and irreversibility affect the probability of participation. Option values play a significant role in farmer decisions to retire land by reducing the probability of participation. These results have implications for the design and implementation of conservation programs.",

      "abstract": "There is a growing desire on the part of environmental and conservation groups to see agricultural programs that remove cropland from production, or that require soil and input conservation, be used to protect or improve water quality. Such programs could become powerful tools for addressing an important source of water pollution. One such program is the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP). Many environmental groups are looking upon the CRP as a way of retiring from production cropland which is contributing to water quality problems. Senators Robert Dole and Wyche Fowler have each proposed expansions of the CRP specifically to address water quality issues. The Environmental Protection Agency is encouraging states either to incorporate the CRP into their plans to meet the nonpoint source pollution requirements of the 1987 Water Quality Act, or to develop their own CRP-like programs. Most discussions of how to approach the problem of nonpoint source pollution involve targeting programs to problem watersheds. For example, Section 319 of the 1987 Water Quality Act requires states to identify priority watersheds for treatment of nonpoint source pollution problems. Such targeting implies there exist criteria upon which areas can be ranked for the purpose of implementing water quality improvement measures. The criteria selected are",

Unfortunately, benefit transfers can also result in biased welfare estimates. In this paper, we suggest a method of calibrating the benefit transfer to reduce this bias. An empirical example to determine the benefits of the Conservation Reserve Program on water‐based recreation illustrates the potentially large biases that can result if the transfer is not calibrated.",

      "abstract": "This report estimates the impact that high levels of enrollment in the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) have had on economic trends in rural counties since the program's inception in 1985 until today. The results of a growth model and quasi-experimental control group analysis indicate no discernible impact by the CRP on aggregate county population trends. Aggregate employment growth may have slowed in some high-CRP counties, but only temporarily. High levels of CRP enrollment appear to have affected farm-related businesses over the long run, but growth in the number of other nonfarm businesses moderated CRP's impact on total employment. If CRP contracts had ended in 2001, simulation models suggest that roughly 51 percent of CRP land would have returned to crop production, and that spending on outdoor recreation would decrease by as much as $300 million per year in rural areas. The resulting impacts on employment and income vary widely among regions having similar CRP enrollments, depending upon local economic conditions.",

We analyze micro data on observed land-use choices following CRP contract expiration over 1995–1997 and predict that 42% of CRP acres would not have been returned to crops within a year if the program had expired in 1997. These results indicate that temporary cropland retirement payments under CRP generate land-use changes that often extend beyond contract periods. The analysis suggests that targeted signing bonuses for first-time enrollees would increase the longer-term impacts of CRP and perhaps other incentive-based land-use programs.</i> (JEL Q24)",

Recent research by Wu (2000) found that slippage—an unintended stimulus of new plantings—offsets some of CRP's environmental benefits. In a comment on Wu, we argued CRP enrollments were endogenous and confounded by omitted variables. In his reply, Wu (2005) used results from a Hausman test to argue that CRP enrollments are exogenous. In this rejoinder, we explain why the candidate instrument (erodibility) is likely confounded by omitted variables, so Wu's use of the Hausman test is uninformative.",

      "abstract": "To determine the relative value of different Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) plantings for breeding grassland and winter birds we measured vegetation structure, avian abundance and reproductive success, and estimated fecundity during 1993–1995 on CP1 (cool-season grass) and CP2 (warm-season grass) plantings in 16 fields in northern Missouri. CP1 fields had been planted to cool-season grasses or cool-season grass-legume mixtures and CP2 fields had been seeded with switchgrass (Panicum virgatum). Species richness, abundance and nesting success of grassland birds during the breeding season and total bird use in the winter did not differ between CPs. During the breeding season CP1 fields had higher abundances of grasshopper sparrow (Ammodramus savannarum), eastern meadowlark (Sturnella magna), Henslow's sparrow (Ammodramus henslowii) and American goldfinches (Carduelis tristis), whereas common yellowthroats (Geothlypis trichas) were more abundant in CP2 fields. Fecundity of dickcissels (Spiza americana) and nesting success and fecundity of red-winged blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus) were higher on CP2 than on CP1 habitat, but both CPs were likely sinks (λ < 1) for these species. Both CPs were likely source (λ > 1) habitat for grasshopper sparrows, whereas only CP1 habitat was likely a source for eastern meadowlarks and American goldfinches. In winter American goldfinches were more abundant in CP1 fields than CP2 fields. The shorter, more diverse, cool-season grass fields were equal or better habitat than taller, more vertically dense, switchgrass-dominated fields for grassland birds, including several species of high conservation concern. Single-species plantings of warm- or cool-season grasses should be avoided to increase the potential wildlife benefits of CRP and other grassland habitats.",

      "abstract": "Declining avian populations in the Midwest have increased interest in various aspects of grassland habitats and their effects on grassland birds. We studied the effects of vegetation characteristics, woody field edges, and surrounding land use on abundance and daily nest survival of the dickcissel (Spiza americana) in Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) fields in northeastern Kansas. We observed 873 dickcissels during surveys on 11 CRP fields during the summers of 1994 and 1995. In those fields, we located 186 dickcissel nests of which 13.2% were successful in 1994 and 14.9% were successful in 1995. The vertical density of vegetation in CRP fields, wooded area surrounding the fields, and amount of woody edge bordering fields were associated with dickcissel abundance (P = 0.001). Live and dead canopy cover and litter cover were associated with daily nest survival (P = 0.005). Therefore, the habitat quality of CRP fields for dickcissels might be enhanced by modifying vegetation characteristics. The outcome of any modifications of CRP habitat for dickcissels should be judged on changes in the number and success of their nests rather than on the abundance of birds.",

A theoretical model is presented to analyze the interaction between farmers' CRP participation decisions and land values. Empirical models are estimated to evaluate the effects of the CRP on land values. Results suggest that CRP participation had the largest effects in the Mountain, Southern Plains, and Northern Plains regions, where it increased average farmland values by 5% to 14%, 4% to 6%, and 2% to 5%, respectively. The CRP also had a statistically significant effect on developed land values, but the percentage increases were smaller. Implications of the results for the design of conservation programs are discussed. (JEL Q24, Q28)",

If marginal land rents decrease with acres farmed then a least‐cost CRP is a set of nonlinear price schedules. If marginal land rents are independent of acres farmed then an offer system constitutes a least‐cost CRP. The least‐cost offer system gives a useful estimate of the upper bound of a least‐cost CRP. Empirical results suggest that a 34‐million‐acre CRP should have cost no more than $@@‐@@1 billion per year.",

      "abstract": "This report estimates the impact that high levels of enrollment in the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) have had on economic trends in rural counties since the program’s inception in 1985 until today. The results of a growth model and quasi-experimental control group analysis indicate no discernible impact by the CRP on aggregate county population trends. Aggregate employment growth may have slowed in some high-CRP counties, but only temporarily. High levels of CRP enrollment appear to have affected farm-related businesses over the long run, but growth in the number of other nonfarm businesses moderated CRP’s impact on total employment. If CRP contracts had ended in 2001, simulation models suggest that roughly 51 percent of CRP land would have returned to crop production, and that spending on outdoor recreation would decrease by as much as $300 million per year in rural areas. The resulting impacts on employment and income vary widely among regions having similar CRP enrollments, depending upon local economic conditions.",

      "abstract": "One objective of the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) is to reduce the erosion of fragile land. Additional objectives are to decrease surplus production of agricultural commodities and to provide income support for farmers. The direct net impact on farm income is the CRP payment less the farmer share of establishing cover on the land and the lost returns from taking the acreage out of production. It has long been recognized that farm program payments tied to production are capitalized into land values (see, e.g., Herdt and Cochrane 1966; Floyd 1965; Offutt and Shoemaker 1988). Traditional price support programs have this effect because the increases in returns tend to accrue to land because of its relatively inelastic supply. However, the existing target price program provides farmers with a trade-off between increased market earnings due to supply control and receiving deficiency payments. Because existing supply control programs are voluntary, participation in the program requires the payment to be more economically attractive at the margin than producing on the acreage, in which case the program benefits are directly tied to acreage reductions and will tend to be capitalized into land values. As with target price and acreage reduction programs, the impact of the CRP on land values depends on the net effect on expected farm income and returns to land. That is, how big is the increase in land returns over the next best alternative and",

      "abstract": "The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) is the largest agricultural land-retirement program in the United States, providing many environmental benefits, including wildlife habitat and improved air, water, and soil quality. Since 2007, however, CRP area has declined by over 25% nationally with much of this land returning to agriculture. Despite this trend, it is unclear what types of CRP land are being converted, to what crops, and where. All of these specific factors greatly affect environmental impacts. To answer these questions, we quantified shifts in expiring CRP parcels to five major crop-types (corn, soy, winter and spring wheat, and sorghum) in a 12-state, Midwestern region of the United States using a US Department of Agriculture (USDA), field-level CRP database and USDA's Cropland Data Layer. For the years 2010 through 2013, we estimate almost 30%, or more than 530 000 ha, of expiring CRP land returned to the production of these five crops in our study area, with soy and corn accounting for the vast majority of these shifts. Grasslands were the largest type of CRP land converted (360 000 ha), followed by specifically designated wildlife habitat (76 000 ha), and wetland areas (53 000 ha). These wetland areas were not just wetlands themselves, but also a mix of land covers enhancing or protecting wetland ecosystem services (e.g., wetland buffers). Areas in the Dakotas, Nebraska, and southern Iowa were hotspots of change, with the highest areas of CRP land moving back to agriculture. By contrast, we estimate only a small amount (∼3%) of the expiring land shifted into similar, non-CRP land-retirement or easement programs. Reconciling needs for food, feed, fuel, and healthy ecosystems is an immense challenge for farmers, conservationists, and state and federal agencies. Reduced enrollment and the turnover of CRP land from conservation to agriculture raises questions about sustaining ecosystem services in this region.",

      "abstract": "Honey bee colony performance and health are intimately linked to the foraging environment. Recent evidence suggests that the US Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) has a positive impact on environmental suitability for supporting honey bee apiaries. However, relatively little is known about the influence of habitat conservation efforts on honey bee colony health. Identifying specific factors that influence bee health at the colony level incorporates longitudinal monitoring of physiology across diverse environments. Using a pooled-sampling method to overcome individual variation, we monitored colony-level molecular biomarkers during critical pre- and post-winter time points. Major categories of colony health (nutrition, oxidative stress resistance, and immunity) were impacted by apiary site. In general, apiaries within foraging distance of CRP lands showed improved performance and higher gene expression of vitellogenin (vg), a nutritionally regulated protein with central storage and regulatory functions. Mirroring vg levels, gene transcripts encoding antioxidant enzymes and immune-related proteins were typically higher in colonies exposed to CRP environments. Our study highlights the potential of CRP lands to improve pollinator health and the utility of colony-level molecular diagnostics to assess environmental suitability for honey bees.",

Commodity groups, conservation and environmental organizations, contract holders, and local interests are all asking what the Federal government plans for CRP land as contracts end. Early resolution by Congress and the administration would allow producers time to plan for the transition. However, if action comes, it will likely be deferred to the next farm bill expected in 1995.\n\nAbout 36.5 million acres of highly erodible or environmentally-sensitive cropland have been enrolled in the CRP under 10-year contracts (2). The first contracts, covering two million acres, expire in October 1995. But October 1996 and 1997 are the big years when contracts on more than 22 million acres expire. The expiration of CRP contracts raises concerns over the extent of conservation, wildlife, and environmental reversals that will occur, particularly if commodity markets are favorable in 1996 and 1997.\n\nWasn't this problem anticipated in the 1985 farm …",

      "abstract": "This paper presents the methodology, assumptions, and data used to generate regional and national environmental benefit estimates of the USDA's Conservation Reserve Program (CRP). It's assumed that, without the program, production and conservation practices on CRP lands would be the same as those used on surrounding lands. When range and forest lands are (are not) included as land-use options, 54 (71) percent of the CRP land would be in crop production—which is consistent with past analyses. Soil erosion would be 222 to 248 million tons per year—about 11 percent—higher than the current level. Benefits are estimated by applying environmental benefit models, estimated in previous analyses, to the CRP's estimated effect on erosion and wildlife habitat. Nationally, the CRP is estimated to provide $1.3 billion in annual benefits, which represents 75 to 80 percent of the program's cost. In seven of the 10 USDA Farm Production Regions, the CRP's environmental benefits exceed costs. Thus, reallocating acreage to these regions could increase net program benefits. However, because many benefits could not be estimated, one cannot conclude that regional and national benefits do not exceed costs.",

      "abstract": "To elucidate the role of microorganisms for C and N sequestration in arable soils converted to grassland (sites of the Conservation Reserve Program; CRP), we determined amino sugars as indicators for microbial residues in surface samples (0–5 cm) obtained from each of 10 adjacent native grassland, CRP, and cropland sites across the U.S. Great Plains. The CRP sites were 6 to 10 yr and the cropland sites were &gt;80 yr old. Compared with native grasslands, the CRP sites had lost between 17 and 50% and the cropland sites between 32 and 94% of their surface soil organic matter (SOM). The C/N ratio was not significantly different among the three land‐use systems, indicating that C and N losses occurred at similar intensity. The mean amino sugar concentrations decreased in the order native grassland (70 g kg −1 C; 750 g kg −1 N) &gt; CRP (53 g kg −1 C; 570 g kg −1 N) &gt; cropland (47 g kg −1 C; 450 g kg −1 N). This decrease in the element‐normalized concentrations of amino sugars indicated that they responded faster to management than other C or N containing compounds. The response of individual amino sugars related to soil compaction and the temperature regime. We suggest that the resequestration of C and N into the residues of bacteria and fungi requires several years, but as it depends on land use it could be manipulated using, for example, soil decompacting techniques to improve CRP efficiency.",

As such, considerable interest exists in the overall economic efficiency and in potential modifications of the program.\n\nThe results of a detailed Economic Research Service study ( 3 ) form the basis for discussing the probable economic effects on national income resulting from retiring 45 million acres by 1991. The study estimated the effect of a 45-million-acre CRP because this level of enrollment was believed attainable at the time of the analysis. The CRP, of course, is a voluntary long-term cropland retirement program. In exchange for retiring cropland with highly erodible soils or other environmentally sensitive land for 10 years, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) pays CRP participants (farm owners or operators) an annual per-acre rent and one-half of the cost of establishing a permanent land cover. The CRP's primary goal is to reduce soil erosion on highly erodible cropland. Secondary objectives of …",

      "abstract": "Abstract The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) pays farmers about $2 billion per year to retire cropland under ten‐ to fifteen‐year contracts. Recent research by Wu found that slippage—an unintended stimulus of new plantings—offsets some of CRP's environmental benefits. Wu does not account for the endogeneity of CRP enrollments. Furthermore, the data used by Wu cannot be used to estimate slippage arising from a price feedback effect. We replicate Wu's findings, demonstrate the possible presence of spurious correlation, and construct new estimates with corrections for endogeneity and other econometric problems. We find no convincing evidence of slippage.",

      "abstract": "The decision to participate in a Government program can be viewed as a discrete choice problem, where a farmer will choose to sign up for the program if the expected utility of participating outweighs the expected utility of not participating. In this article, the probability of farmer participation in the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) is modeled as a discrete choice problem and the model is estimated based on data for the entire United States. Results from the first three CRP signup periods indicate that farm tenure, farm size, land value, farmer age, erosion rate, and expected net returns with and without participation influence the probability of CRP participation. These results can be useful in evaluating how farmers might react to similar programs.",

      "abstract": "Abstract There is limited knowledge of biochemical processes in low carbon content soils of semiarid regions under different land use and management. This study investigated several enzyme activities of C, N, P, and S transformations in semiarid soils with different clay (10–21 %) and sand (59–85 %) contents that were under conservation reserve program (CRP), native rangeland (NR), and cropland (CL) under sunflowers ( Eriophyllum ambiguum (Gray) ), continuous cotton ( Gossypium hirsutum L.), or in rotations with wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) or sorghum ( Sorghum bicolor L.) in West Texas, USA. Soils under CRP and NR showed higher total C and N contents than cultivated soils under continuous cotton, but soil pH (6.7–8.4) was not affected by the management or land use studied. The activities of β‐glucosidase, β‐glucosaminidase, arylamidase, acid and alkaline phosphatase, phosphodiesterase, and arylsulfatase (mg product (kg soil) –1 h –1 ) were lower in CL under continuous cotton compared to cotton in rotation with other crops, CRP, and NR. The enzyme activities were also lower when compared to soils from other regions. Linear regression analyses indicated positive correlations between enzyme activities and total C ( r values up to 0.96, P &lt; 0.01). There was a positive relationship between enzyme activities and total N, but soil pH showed the opposite trend. Enzyme activities were significantly intercorrelated with r values up to 0.98 ( P &lt; 0.001). The specific enzyme activities (mg product (g organic C) –1 ) were lower in continuous cotton in comparison to the uncultivated soils (i.e., NR and CRP) reflecting differences in organic matter quantity and quality due to cultivation. Among the enzymes studied, the specific activities of β‐glucosidase and arylamidase showed a more pronounced decrease with increasing soil depth. In general, soils under CRP or wheat‐cotton rotations revealed higher enzyme activities than soils under the common agricultural practice for these regions, i.e., continuous cotton under conventional tillage.",

Younger CRP fields (1-2 years old), best described as a combination of forbs and bare ground, had the greatest diversity and relative abundance of avian species. Older CRP fields (3-5/6 years old) were a combination of grasses and deep litter cover and had the greatest avian productivity. We recommend that after 3-5 growing seasons CRP fields be manipulated to provide a variety of successional stages to maintain simultaneously high avian relative abundance, diversity, and productivity.

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT:  No-till and moldboard plow tillage systems were established on a former Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) site in southwest Iowa. Runoff rates from simulated rainfall events were significantly greater on sites returned to crop production than from adjoining, undisturbed CRP areas. Substantial soil loss was measured from the moldboard plow treatments, but no significant differences in erosion rates were found between the undisturbed CRP and no-till management systems. No-till management maintained levels of soil quality similar to those of CRP by preserving soil structural integrity and reducing losses of soil organic matter (SOM) associated with tillage. Conservation tillage systems which maintain residue materials on the soil surface may be well suited for former CRP areas which are used as cropland.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The study examines Louisiana small farmers' reasons for not participating in the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), their awareness of the program, and their willingness to participate in the program. The results suggest that: farmers do not participate in the CRP if revenues from cropland are an important source of income, or if they are tenants; awareness is significantly related to education, income, race, and average return per acre; willingness is positively influenced by payment per acre, age, and farm status. Participation depends on whether payments per acre are comparable to the opportunity costs of removing cropland from production.",
